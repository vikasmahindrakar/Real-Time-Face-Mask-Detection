# Real-Time-Face-Mask-Detection

This repository contains a Capstone Project on Real-Time Face Mask Detection. The project aims to develop a system that can detect whether individuals are wearing face masks in real-time using computer vision techniques. This application is particularly relevant in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, where wearing masks has become essential to prevent virus spread.

Features
Real-Time Detection: Utilizes live video feed to detect face masks.
High Accuracy: Implemented with advanced machine learning algorithms to ensure precise detection.
User-Friendly Interface: Easy-to-use interface designed for seamless interaction.
Scalable and Efficient: Optimized for performance to handle multiple detections simultaneously.
Technologies Used
Python: The core programming language used for development.
OpenCV: For real-time computer vision processing.
TensorFlow/Keras: Used for building and training the machine learning models.
Jupyter Notebook: For development and experimentation.
